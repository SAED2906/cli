##Intro
These are my shell commands for my archlinux i3 boot.
i coded them so i can freeze, sleep, and shutdown my computer from the commandline easily. 

##Instructions
If you want to use these commands remember to give them execute permissions using chmod, run: 

``` chmod +x <name_of_script>.sh ```

and then just run the shell command with 

```./<name_of_script>.sh```
